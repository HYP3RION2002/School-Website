# Coastal School — Static Website

This is a simple, static website scaffold for a coastal school with a white and blue design, a navigation bar, photo gallery, and a progress section.

Quick start:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local dev server).

2. Replace the placeholder SVGs in the `images/` folder with your own photos. Supported files: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`.

3. To preview with a simple server (recommended), run in the project folder:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Files:

- `index.html` — main HTML
- `css/styles.css` — styles (white & blue theme)
- `js/script.js` — interactive behavior (nav, modal, progress)
- `images/` — placeholder images
